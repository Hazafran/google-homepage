I copied the **Google homepage** as my first HTML/CSS project with Odin. It have been difficult in the beginning because I had no idea about how to apply all the info I learned through the lessons.

But through the process of figuring out on my own and heavily researching on Google each thing I had a problem with, it eased a lot and gave me the understanding necessary for laying out simple HTML/CSS pages.

What is clear to me is that the only true way of learning is **by doing**. No lesson is going to teach me how to actually do stuff. It's only trial and error, tinkering with the code and searching any doubt in the web.

What I learned:

* To position any element in a page.
* To use flexbox to make responsive elements.
* The CSS box model.
* How to style any element through colors, borders, shadows...
* How element structure works, inheritance. I now realize how clumsy my code is and how can I structure it better next time.
